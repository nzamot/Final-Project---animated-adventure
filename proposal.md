# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I'm in between a visual story or making a game on renpy. I will most likely call it something like "Forgotten Isles or Whispers of the Forest"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I want to story tell about an adventure in a forest or island either in a visual story or in a story game.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The project involves developing a story-driven game using Renpy, set in either a mystical forest or on a captivating isle. The software will allow players to navigate through the narrative by making decisions that influence the storyline's outcome. Key features will include branching paths, dynamic character interactions, environmental puzzles, and multiple endings. The execution will involve scripting the narrative, designing artwork, and implementing game mechanics using Ren'Py's capabilities. Iterative playtesting will be conducted to refine the gameplay experience.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

Not Applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

I'm working by myself.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I a good outcome is creating a storyline and creating somewhat thorough and complete characters. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be creating an interesting storyline and creating thorough and complete characters and settings.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be creating a well developed storyline/plot, and creating detailed characters and settings. Maybe adding sounds/music of my own. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The next steps involve honing my skills in Renpy scripting and game design principles to effectively execute the project. I'll need to delve into tutorials and documentation to deepen my understanding of Renpy's capabilities and refine my scripting abilities. Researching environmental design principles for the forest or isle setting and studying effective puzzle design will be crucial for creating an immersive gameplay experience.
